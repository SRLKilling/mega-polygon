# mega-polygon
An homemade extended version of the epic SuperHexagon game

## To be continued...

Unfortunatly, I've lost the sources a while ago.  
I've successfully decompiled the apk, but I need to refactor the sources to be able to continue the project.  
In the meanwhile time, here are some videos of the last version I've sent on my Android device. (lags are due to the recording software and gif converter, they're not present during the game)
